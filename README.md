      We are a group of High School students making a video game, with the support of our teacher and OGPC, Oregon Game Project Challenge. The theme this year is <q>Connections</q> and our game will be called Encumbered. Our game has several different story-lines within it, and is based mostly on the choices you make within game play. This game will not be platform, but instead mainly storyline that changes based on what you decide to do. We have seven members on our team, Eden  (our leader), Aubrey  (Our main artist), Talia (One of our main writers, and artists), Skylla  (Our main programmer and artists), Brandon  (Our sound effects and music maker), and Tara (One of our artists, one of our main story designers,  and the person in charge of all social media).

    <h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
<p>      
    This game follows around our main character, Billiam. Billiam is a high school student in the 10th grade, and he just so happened to be assigned to be partners for a film project with a girl in his class, Sophia. Sophia, however, is having personal problems, and doesn't particularly want to be partners with Billiam. After being shot down by Sophia several times and finding himself curious about her, he starts to ask around. Will Billiam connect with Sophia, or will they be doomed to a bad project and an even worse relationship?
